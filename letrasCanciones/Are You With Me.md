# Are you with me

I wanna dance by water 'neath the Mexican sky  
Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights  
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight  

Are you with me, are you with me?  
Are you with me?  
Are you with me?  

Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights  
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight  
Are you with me, are you with me?  

I wanna dance by water 'neath the Mexican sky   
Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights   
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight  
Are you with me, are you with me?  
Are you with me?  

I wanna dance by water 'neath the Mexican sky  
Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights  
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight  
Are you with me, are you with me?  

I wanna dance by water 'neath the Mexican sky  
Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights  
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight  
Are you with me, are you with me?

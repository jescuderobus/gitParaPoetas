# Grace Kelly

I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky  
I could be hurtful, I could be purple, I could be anything you like

- Comentario en Geniusly: The narrator is willing to change his whole personality and be anything that needs to be just to be accepted by his loved one. He could change color (possibly implying skin color), or the color of his personality (being blue implies being sad), he could be hurtful, green or mean. These three ways of acting carry a negative connotation, as being green is synonymous with envious, being hurtful and mean is also a negative thing, but it only shows that he’s willing to try anything to appeal to his loved one.

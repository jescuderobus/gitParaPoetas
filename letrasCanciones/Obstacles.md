Let's say sunshine for everyone
But as far as I can remember
We've been migratory animals
Living under changing weather
Someday we will foresee obstacles
Through the blizzard, through the blizzard
Today we will sell our uniform
Live together
Live together
We played hide and seek in waterfalls
We were younger
We were younger
We played hide and seek in waterfalls
We were younger
We were younger
We played hide and seek in waterfalls
We were younger
We were younger
We played hide and seek in waterfalls
We were younger
We were younger
Someday we will foresee obstacles
Through the blizzard, through the blizzard

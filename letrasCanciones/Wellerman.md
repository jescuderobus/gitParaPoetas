# Wellerman

There once was a ship that put to sea  
And the name of that ship was the Billy o' Tea  
The winds blew hard, her bow dipped down  
Blow, me bully boys, blow (Huh!)  

Soon may the Wellerman come  
To bring us sugar and tea and rum  
One day, when the tonguin' is done  
We'll take our leave and go  

She had not been two weeks from shore  
When down on her a right whale bore  
The captain called all hands and swore  
He'd take that whale in tow (Hah!)  

Soon may the Wellerman come  
To bring us sugar and tea and rum  
One day, when the tonguin' is done  
We'll take our leave and go  

Before the boat had hit the water  
The whale's tail came up and caught her  
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her  
When she dived down below (Huh!)  

Soon may the Wellerman come  
To bring us sugar and tea and rum  
One day, when the tonguin' is done  
We'll take our leave and go  

No line was cut, no whale was freed;  
The Captain's mind was not on greed  
But he belonged to the whaleman's creed;  
She took that ship in tow (Huh!)  

Soon may the Wellerman come  
To bring us sugar and tea and rum  
One day, when the tonguin' is done  
We'll take our leave and go  

For forty days, or even more  
The line went slack, then tight once more  
All boats were lost, there were only four  
But still that whale did go  

Soon may the Wellerman come  
To bring us sugar and tea and rum  
One day, when the tonguin' is done  
We'll take our leave and go  

As far as I've heard, the fight's still on;  
The line's not cut and the whale's not gone  
The Wellerman makes his a regular call  
To encourage the Captain, crew, and all  

Soon may the Wellerman come  
To bring us sugar and tea and rum  
One day, when the tonguin' is done  
We'll take our leave and go  

Soon may the Wellerman come  
To bring us sugar and tea and rum  
One day, when the tonguin' is done  
We'll take our leave and go

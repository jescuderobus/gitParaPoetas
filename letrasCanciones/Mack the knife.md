# Mack the knife 

Oh the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear  
And he shows them pearly white  
Just a jackknife has old Macheath, babe  
And he keeps it outta sight  

You know when that shark bites with his teeth, babe  
Scarlet billows start to spread  
Fancy gloves, though, wears ol' Macheath, babe  
So there's never, never a trace of red  

Now, on the side walk, ooh Sunday morning, uh huh  
Lies a body just oozing life, eek  
And someone's sneaking 'round the corner  
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?  

There's a tugboat down by the river, don't you know  
Where a cement bag's just a-drooping on down  
Oh, that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear  
Five'll get ya ten, ol' Mackie's back in town  

Now did ya hear 'bout Louie Miller? He disappeared, babe  
After drawing out all his hard earned cash  
And now Macheath spends just like a sailor  
Could it be our boy's done something rash?  

Now, Jenny Diver, ho ho, Suky Tawdry  
Ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya and ol' Lucy Brown  
Oh, the line forms on the right, babe  
Now that Mackie's back in town  

I said, Jenny Diver, woah, Suky Tawdry  
Look out, Miss Lotte Lenya and ol' Lucy Brown  
Yes, that line forms on the right, babe  
Now that Mackie's back in town  

Look out ol' Mackie is back
